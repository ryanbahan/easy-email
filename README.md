### UPDATE: As of June 2020, Easy Email will no longer be supporting tone analysis via machine learning. I hope to revisit this concept in the future, but for now it's not financially feasible to continue using IBM Watson for this feature. If you're experienced in ML and interested in working on this, please reach out!

### 1. Abstract

Coding emails is hard. Figuring out if they're worth sending is harder. Easy Email allows users of all skills levels to create beautiful, deployable emails with no code required. Even better - Easy Email leverages machine learning to analyze the emotional sentiment of your email content. Never be in the dark on emails again.
